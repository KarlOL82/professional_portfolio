#Professional Portfolio
A deployed webpage with eamples of my work, contact info, and a bio.

## Mission Statement

This page was created to showcase my course work to date using html and CSS on a deployed live webpage.

This project contains key elements from the first 2 class modules.

This page was made without any starter code using only html and CSS techniques. The portfolio will be updated with additional project and utilize additional development tools as the class progresses.

###

-Making a live webpage from scratch is HARD! I need to practice daily to make better looking pages.

-CSS can be finicky and it's easy to overdo the styling if you get carried away.

-Need to be mindful of image size going forward, the images I used were difficult to get to do what I wanted.
