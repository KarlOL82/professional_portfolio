        <p>Originally from Helsingborg, Sweden, my family moved to the Seattle area when I was just 2 years old. 
            I believe that spending my formative years in a multilingual environment has given me a natural proclivity to the world of coding.</p>
         <p>I spent several years in the restauraunt industry in many different capacities, most notably bartending and managing. This taught me a great deal about how a business
         runs, the value of hard work, the importance of deadlines, and most importantly of all, people. </p>
         <p> In more recent years, I have taken some of the business and people skills gleaned from the restaurant and bar industry and applied them
             in other areas including Amazon Fulfillment and at my most recent employer: Asentria. I currently manage inventory and receiving as well as handle domestic purchasing.</p>
        <p> My goal is to establish a foundation of broad knowledge and effective working habits in the development space by securing employment with a company whose resources and peer network
            can allow me to develop my skills while benefitting from my work ethic and life experience.</p>
            <p>In my spare time I enjoy hiking in the beautiful mountains and forests of the pacific northwest, reading, and supporting the Seattle Sounders FC!</p>
